# Spark Structured Streaming Examples

## Introduction

The project contains complete Spark applications (using Scala and sbt) to demonstrate various features of Spark Structured Streaming:

* [FlatMapGroupsWithStateApp](src/main/scala/pl/japila/spark/FlatMapGroupsWithStateApp.scala)
* [GroupbyAppendWatermarkExample](src/main/scala/pl/japila/spark/GroupbyAppendWatermarkExample.scala)
* [StreamingAggregationApp](src/main/scala/pl/japila/spark/StreamingAggregationApp.scala)
* [StreamStreamJoinApp](src/main/scala/pl/japila/spark/StreamStreamJoinApp.scala)

**TIP**: Read up on the features in [The Internals of Spark Structured Streaming](https://bit.ly/spark-structured-streaming) online book.

## Getting Started

Just browse [src/main/scala](src/main/scala/pl/japila/spark) directory and read the scaladoc of the example of your interest.
