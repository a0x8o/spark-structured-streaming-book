# UnsupportedOperationChecker

`UnsupportedOperationChecker` checks whether the [logical plan of a streaming query uses supported operations only](#checkForStreaming).

`UnsupportedOperationChecker` is used when the internal [spark.sql.streaming.unsupportedOperationCheck](configuration-properties.md#spark.sql.streaming.unsupportedOperationCheck) Spark property is enabled.

!!! note
    `UnsupportedOperationChecker` comes actually with two methods, i.e. `checkForBatch` and <<checkForStreaming, checkForStreaming>>, whose names reveal the different flavours of Spark SQL (as of 2.0), i.e. batch and streaming, respectively.

    The Spark Structured Streaming gitbook is solely focused on <<checkForStreaming, checkForStreaming>> method.

## <span id="checkForStreaming"> checkForStreaming Method

```scala
checkForStreaming(
  plan: LogicalPlan,
  outputMode: OutputMode): Unit
```

`checkForStreaming` asserts that the following requirements hold:

1. <<only-one-streaming-aggregation-allowed, Only one streaming aggregation is allowed>>

1. <<streaming-aggregation-append-mode-requires-watermark, Streaming aggregation with Append output mode requires watermark>> (on the grouping expressions)

1. <<multiple-flatMapGroupsWithState, Multiple flatMapGroupsWithState operators are only allowed with Append output mode>>

`checkForStreaming`...FIXME

`checkForStreaming` finds all streaming aggregates (i.e. `Aggregate` logical operators with streaming sources).

!!! note
    `Aggregate` logical operator represents [Dataset.groupBy](operators/groupBy.md) and [Dataset.groupByKey](operators/groupByKey.md) operators (and SQL's `GROUP BY` clause) in a logical query plan.

[[only-one-streaming-aggregation-allowed]]
`checkForStreaming` asserts that there is exactly one streaming aggregation in a streaming query.

Otherwise, `checkForStreaming` reports a `AnalysisException`:

```text
Multiple streaming aggregations are not supported with streaming DataFrames/Datasets
```

[[streaming-aggregation-append-mode-requires-watermark]]
`checkForStreaming` asserts that [watermark](operators/withWatermark.md) was defined for a streaming aggregation with [Append](OutputMode.md#Append) output mode (on at least one of the grouping expressions).

Otherwise, `checkForStreaming` reports a `AnalysisException`:

```text
Append output mode not supported when there are streaming aggregations on streaming DataFrames/DataSets without watermark
```

CAUTION: FIXME

`checkForStreaming` counts all [FlatMapGroupsWithState](logical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithState.md) logical operators (on streaming Datasets with `isMapGroupsWithState` flag disabled).

!!! note
    [FlatMapGroupsWithState.isMapGroupsWithState](logical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithState.md#isMapGroupsWithState) flag is disabled when...FIXME

[[multiple-flatMapGroupsWithState]]
`checkForStreaming` asserts that multiple [FlatMapGroupsWithState](logical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithState.md) logical operators are only used when:

* `outputMode` is [Append](OutputMode.md#Append) output mode

* [outputMode](logical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithState.md#outputMode) of the `FlatMapGroupsWithState` logical operators is also [Append](OutputMode.md#Append) output mode

CAUTION: FIXME Reference to an example in `flatMapGroupsWithState`

Otherwise, `checkForStreaming` reports a `AnalysisException`:

```text
Multiple flatMapGroupsWithStates are not supported when they are not all in append mode or the output mode is not append on a streaming DataFrames/Datasets
```

CAUTION: FIXME

`checkForStreaming` is used when `StreamingQueryManager` is requested to [create a StreamingQueryWrapper](StreamingQueryManager.md#createQuery) (for starting a streaming query), but only when the internal [spark.sql.streaming.unsupportedOperationCheck](configuration-properties.md#spark.sql.streaming.unsupportedOperationCheck) configuration property is enabled.
